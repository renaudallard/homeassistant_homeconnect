"""The dashboard cards this ships, served and made available to add.

A card is put in front of the user as a Lovelace resource, which is what
lists it in the card picker and loads it onto a dashboard, the same way an
installed card is added. Loading it on every page instead does not offer it
in the picker as reliably, and a card that cannot be picked might as well not
ship.

The resource list is loaded from disk before anything is written to it. A
storage-backed list that is written while still unloaded is overwritten whole,
which would take every resource the user already had with it, so the guard
matters more than it looks.
